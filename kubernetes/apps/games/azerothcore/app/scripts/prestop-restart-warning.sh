# worldserver preStop hook: give real players a timed in-game restart warning.
#
# Any orchestrated termination (image bump, config roll via Reloader, node
# drain) runs this BEFORE SIGTERM. If real players are online — AC's
# "Connected players" count excludes bots (WP10-verified) — it SOAPs
# `server restart <N>` against the pod's OWN worldserver, which broadcasts a
# countdown in-game and exits cleanly (full save) when it reaches zero. With
# nobody online (or SOAP unreachable/unparseable) it returns immediately and
# the normal SIGTERM save-and-stop proceeds at full speed.
#
# pod.terminationGracePeriodSeconds must exceed WARN_SECONDS + the hold
# margin below + save time — see the helmrelease comment.
# Emergency bypass: kubectl delete pod <ws-pod> --grace-period=1
#
# Deliberately NO `set -e`: any failure here must degrade to the plain
# SIGTERM path, never wedge the hook.
