# mysqld preStop: before the DB receives SIGTERM, ask the worldserver to flush
# all in-memory character state (`saveall`) so an orchestrated DB roll (image
# update, node drain, reschedule) never rewinds the realm to the last periodic
# save (PlayerSaveInterval is 15 min — that was the 2026-07 progress-loss
# window). The worldserver itself will drop its DB connection and be restarted
# by its SOAP liveness probe once mysqld is gone; with the save flushed first,
# that restart is lossless.
#
# Best-effort by design: if the worldserver is down or hung there is nothing
# to save — log and exit 0 so the DB shutdown is never blocked.
